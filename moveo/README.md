# moveatis 2.0

Moveatis is a web-based software for making observations and feedback analyzations. 
It was first developed in University of Jyv채skyl채, as part of student project in spring 2016 and the version 1.0 was released. That project developed the observation feature. 

Later, in spring 2019, we developed the software further by adding the feedback analyzation as a new feature and refreshed the layout of the software in Moveo-project. Moveo-project was also a student project implemented in University of Jyv채skyl채.

Moveatis runs in Java EE application server, we used Wildfly 15 server in development and production. For database we used PostgreSQL. 
Main UI library is Primefaces, http://primefaces.org

Moveatis is built with Maven, so you should be able to use any IDE, that works with
Maven project files. We used Eclipse IDE.

To develop Moveatis, you need to pull this repository to your machine and install
local webserver and database, where you run the Moveatis.
