inf_whatIsText=<p>Moveatis is a web-based application designed for the analysis of teaching situations. \
The application was developed at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 by the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences and the \
Faculty of Information Technology. Moveatis was developed during two development projects: During the 2016 Moveatis-project \
the observation tool was developed and during the 2019 Moveo- project the feedback analysis tool was developed. This new technology \
stemmed from work carried out in the University's physical education teacher education programme, which has a long tradition \
in the analysis of teacher behaviour in physical education. The Moveatis application focuses on the development of teaching skills in physical \
education, building on the extensive relevant knowledge and competence base developed at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4.</p> \
<p>Moveatis is a form of systematic observation software and includes two separate tools. Moveatis supports the systematic \
observation of teaching through its ability to record the duration and frequency of specific occurrences within a teaching situation. \
The application can be used, for example, to easily record how much time a teacher spends giving instruction, how much time a student is \
physically active or how many times a teacher gives feedback during a lesson. Moveatis also includes a tool for analysing feedback \
by enabling the user the enter 'teacher feedback' into a textbox and then select the corresponding feedback categories. </p>\
<p>Before using the application, great care is required in developing proper definitions of the behaviours to be recorded and analysed. \
Although the Moveatis application was originally designed for the analysis of physical education lessons, it is suitable for analysing \
a variety of teaching-learning situations as it allows the user to select and modify categories according to individual needs.</p>

inf_userGuideText=<p><h4>Log in and user status</h4></p> \
                  <p>The Moveatis application is initiated by selecting the appropriate user status from the home page (moveatis.sport.jyu.fi). \
                  Users can log in as University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 users, by using a group key, or as public users.</p>\
                  <p><i>JYU log in</i></p>\
                  <p>Logged-in users are authorised to create and store events and observation categories and save information \
                  to the application's database, allowing observations to be reloaded to the application later.<p>\
                  <p><i>Group key</i></p>\
                  <p>Users using a group key have access to category groups and observations stored under the specific group key for a given event. \
                  Users using a group key also have the option to send observation results to their own email addresses.</p>\
                  <p><i>Public use</i></p>\
                  <p>Public users may use the application and almost all of its functions. They have the option to add categories \
                  and conduct observations but do not have the authorisation to save results to the application's database. </p>\
                  <p><b>Modifying category groups and categories</b></p>\
                  <p>Prior to observation, the user is guided to a page where category groups and categories belonging to each \
                  category group can be added, removed and modified. JYU log in users have access to a control page where they can \
                  create new events including category sets for observation and feedback analysis. Users can choose to use more than \
                  one category group at the same time. For example, it is possible to choose one category group for teacher \
                  behaviour and another for student behaviour.</p>\
                  <p><b>Observation</b></p>\
                  <p><i>Conducting observations</i></p>\
                  <p>An observation is initiated by pressing the 'play' button, which starts the observation clock. After this, \
                  the user records the actions or events by selecting categories. The 'pause' button stops the clock but allows \
                  observations to continue later. The 'stop' button stops the clock and redirects the user to the summary page.</p>\
                  <p><i>Summary of observations</i></p>\
                  <p>On the summary page, the frequency and/or duration of each recording is displayed. Within each category, the application \
                  displays the total duration and/or frequency as well as percentage values. In addition, \
                  a graph shows each recording on a timeline.</p>\
                  <p><i>Saving observation results</i></p>\
                  <p>The options for saving results depend on the user status. For JYU users, results can be saved to the application's database \
                  via the 'save' button or as a CSV or .png file on the user's own device. In addition, logged-in users or users using a group \
                  key can send the CSV file to their email address to be viewed later in Excel. Public users can save the results to \
                  their own device as a CSV or .png file.<p>\
                  <p><b>Feedback analysis</b></p>\
                  <p><i>Conducting feedback analysis</i></p>\
                  <p>Analysing feedback involves categorizing the teacher feedback within categories defined prior to the analysis \
                  (e.g., negative-positive, general-specific). Users can begin the feedback analysis by entering the feedback type into the text \
                  box and then selecting the corresponding categories. The selected category is displayed in red. To record new feedback, select \
                  the 'new feedback' button to move to a new empty recording space. Users can review recorded feedback episodes using the arrow buttons \
                  at the top of the page. When all feedback episodes are recorded, users can select 'continue to report'.</p>\
                  <p><i>Report</i></p>\
                  <p>The report page shows the all recorded feedback and corresponding categories in one table. Users can edit or delete the \
                  recorded feedback by selecting the 'edit' or 'delete' buttons on the right. The report page can be downloaded as a .png file \
                  to the user's own device by selecting 'download as image'.</p>\
                  <p><i>Summary</i></p>\
                  <p>The summary page shows the frequency and percentages of feedback in different categories in each category set. \
                  Results are also displayed as bar charts and pie charts that can be downloaded as .png files to the user's own device.</p>\
                  <p><i>Editing the csv-file</i></p>\
                  <p>Microsoft Excel does not automatically separate data into its own columns. Data can be separate as follows: \
                  Select the column A by clicking it. Go to <i>Data</i>-tab and select <i>Text to columns</i> function under the <i>Data tools</i> group. \
                  From the dialog that opens, choose <i>Delimited</i> option and click the button <i>Next</i>. In the <i>Delimiters</i> group are all the delimiters, \
                  choose <i>Comma</i> and click <i>Finish</i>.</p>

                <p>The Moveo project was carried out in cooperation between the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences and the Faculty of Information \
                Technology at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in 2019. In the Moveo project, the main goal was to develop a new feature for \
                feedback analysis. Within the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, Pilvikki Heikinaro-Johansson and Nelli Lyyra contributed \
                knowledge related to analysing teaching situations and defining the requirements for the application. Within the Faculty of Information \
